Heap-Sort Algorithm Approach :

BUILD HEAP
============

Step 1 :  Build heap first by calling heapify algorithm starting from (n/2-1) as ith value .
Step 2 :  Inside heapify algorithm , find indexes of left and right children and check if the indexes are within the bound (n) and see if you can find an index which has 
a value larger than value at index i . Denote that index as 'large' .

Step 3 : If index i and large are not same , swap values at indexes i and large . Also call heapify again with large as the new i .


SORT THE HEAP
=============

After building the heap , call heapsort algorithm with following steps 

Step 0 : Call Algorithm to build the heap as stated above .
Step 1 : Call algorithm starting from n-1 index till 0 .
Step 2 : At each iteration swap value at 0th index with ith index .
Step 3 : Call heapify at each iteration with value as heapify(array,i,0)
