As by AV ,

following problems are variation of Knapsack problem 

* Subset sum problem
* Equal sum partition
* Count of subset sum
* Minimum subset sum difference
* Target sum
* Number of subset with a given difference


* Here initialization/base conditions will be different 

In knapsack Item W[] array , V[] array,W

In coming varaiations , there can only be one array , then we consider it as only weight array .

* constraints like W still needs to be identified in these variations , same as knapsack patterns .
