* Knapsack recursive solution changes to memoized solution in just recursive solution + 2 lines .

We need to create table t for storage/memoization 

* what will be dimensions for it , i.e m*n ?

This will be determined by the variables which are changing in the recursive approach .

For , example in knapsack problem w and n changes .

int t[n+1][w+1]
