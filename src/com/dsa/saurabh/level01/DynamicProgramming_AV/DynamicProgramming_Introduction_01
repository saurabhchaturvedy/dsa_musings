* Never directly start with table of top-down approach .
* DP is enhanced recursion .

How to identify a DP problem ?

* Always we will be given a choice scenario (Recursion)
* Recursion + Overlapping problems (DP)
* Recursive funtion > 2 invocations/call has possibility of having a DP use-case .
* Optimal solution will be asked (Min,Max,Largest) 

How to approach & solve a DP problem ?

* Do not directly create a table first . (never use top-down approach right away !)
* First write a recursive solution for it .
* Memoize it .
* If then required , then use top-down approach .
* Problems with more variations can be directly started with top-down approach .
