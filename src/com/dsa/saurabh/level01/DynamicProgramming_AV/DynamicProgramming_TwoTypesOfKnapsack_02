0-1 Knapsack Problem 

* Subset sum problem 
* Equal sum partition
* Count of subset problem
* Minimum subset sum difference
* Target sum
* # of subset with given difference


* Knapsack problem 

* Fractional knapsack - Greedy. (We can put items as half in bag to maximize profit) (No DP approach)
* 0-1 knapsack (We can only put item as a whole) - We can only put one instance of item in the bag , not again and again
* Unbounded knapsack - we can put as many instances as we want of an item in the bag


Input : No. of items , Weight[]array , Value[]array. W = max-capacity
* Maximize the profit by putting items such that max profit is achieved with constraint of Max weight keeping in mind .
